This repository demonstrates a common error in using JavaScript's `addEventListener` method within an HTML file. The error arises from an incorrect implementation of the `addEventListener` function, where the event type is missing. The `bug.html` file contains the erroneous code, and the `bugSolution.html` provides the corrected code.  The bug lies in improperly using the `addEventListener` function, missing the event type causing the event listener not to function properly.
